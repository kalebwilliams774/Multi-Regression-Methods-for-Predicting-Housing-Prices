# Multi-Regression-Methods-for-Predicting-Housing-Prices
Use of ordinary linear regression (OLR), LASSO regression and Ridge regression to predict the housing prices with RMSE accuracy metric for comparison in R.

This analysis uses ordinary linear regression, LASSO and Ridge regressions to make compairsons on housing prices through various data sets. RMSE was used as the accuracy metric for compairson as is typically done when modelling using regressions.
